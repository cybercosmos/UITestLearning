# UI Testing - Reinforcement Learning

Project is on-going

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
(TODO)

## Updates


<!--
TODO: 

2) to collect parent and child nodes as well
discriminiation between what is filled in and what is generated by system
contextual meanings (siblings/parents/children) e.g. 1-away
relationship distance = 1

3) Optimization of the for loops
4) Use database MongoDB
5) Consider using instance to optmize
list of data for what will be collectedz

literature review of model for sentimental analysis-like analysis 
twitter-like NN model

Consider using database MongoDB

### 11 September 2017
* Optimized improvement for a few seconds
* Removed text in clickable storage since it isn't representative of an unchangeable unique key
* Added parent node to clickable data structure

### 10 September 2017
* Determine which activity page is more useful. == giving scores to activity based on no. of clickables
* Added length parameter into data_activity object for faster matching of length of clickables
* Added score parameter for optimization.

### 6 September 2017
* Added mutation for decision of choosing buttons
* Initialization of scores changed to 1 instead for mutation
* Removed subtraction of -1 to score if no change states 

### 4 September 2017
* Added logging into project
* Fixed bugs
* Issue with speed after trying it out with calculator
* New activities are now added to data structure
* activity_transition of buttons added to data structure

### 3 September 2017
* Changed to python3 for latest implementations.
* Changed key structure for node to score dictionary
* Addressed the structure of storage
* Added storing and loading of data structure in json format 


### 30 August 2017
* Implemented supervised learning and labeling for the clicks done so as to glean for further information to classify them.
* Word to score ratio is being kept in a dictionary and stored in json format within a file.


### 21 August 2017
* `get_state()` of UI is done with index of xml dump.
* Added some random clicks and clicks with filling of text.
* The analysis of data(descriptions) is to be done, and will most likely be done using a database/RL style


### 17 August 2017
* Changing to python wrapper for UI automator for the dump method
* Using dump method of the current UI in order to `get_state()` of the current representation of the UI
* Will be doing analysis on words crawled from many APKs so as to do learning on the button descriptions

### 15 August 2017
* The UI Testing automation is done using [Appium framework](https://http://appium.io/)
* Currently able to obtain all relevant elements within the Android application using just the APK file to run.
* A basic test is implemented
    * Lacking a good way to `get_state()` of current activity.
    * The current method is to form a list of `resourceID` for all elements present on the activity and compare it with the previous state.

### TODO:
* `get_state()` of activity so that a _Dynamic Activity Transition Graph_ could be formed.
* Attempt using SCanDroid to obtain the _Static Activity Transition Graph_ so that accurate activity coverage could be measured
* Implement activity and method coverage

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
